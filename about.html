      <h1>About</h1>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I am a writer and media researcher interested in the development and disintegration of new media forms, as well as public perception of these changes. I graduated cum laude from Barnard College in 2013, where my English thesis explored how the New York Times grappled with the popular adoption of the Web in the mid 90s. Additional writing and research has explored how piracy affects the citation record of academic journals; video games in museum/art contexts; and feminist use of digital video remix.</p>
        <p>Professionally, I have directed press and digital media efforts at a variety of organizations, including architecture and design firm Ike Kligerman Barkley, the Hudson River Park Trust, and NYU's Rudin Center for Public Transportation. </p>
